      very important role in the lives of patients. However there are several barriers which hinder
      nurses from doing their day to day responsibilities from their respective health centers. These
      barriers have to be solved to create a good working environment for the nurses’ in order to lead
      change and advance health. The institute of medicine (IOM) report says, there should be an
      absolute follow up on how nurses’ education, roles and responsibilities impact the lives of
      patients in the rapidly diverse population in the society and how to react to the complex

      <h2>Body</h2>
      <p>The chief nursing officer heads <span class="important">the entire nursing workforce</span>  in a given health center and
      his impact determine how the nurses deliver their work. Strict and effective workforce planning
      and policy making is a major impact. These effective planning and policy layout would require
      comprehensive data collection and improved information infrastructure. For a good intensive
      planning to be laid down, there should be effective data collection on the wide range of
      alterations in the education system required to meet the future needs in health care sector. On the
      other hand, once an improved and developed infrastructure for collecting, analyzing and
      representing data is implemented, it ensures that there is an easy logistic evaluation and efficient
      projection of the workforce needs; basing on roles, skills, Centre and demographics leading to
      advanced changes in the nursing practice and education. Hence, these would impact nurses in
      their daily duties.</p>

      <p>To ensure safe delivery of work from nurses, they should be encouraged to acquire higher
      level of education and trainings via a developed education system that encourages coherent
      academic advancement. In our daily lives a lot of changes in health of individuals have occurred
      and more complicated diseases have emerged. Thus, for a nurse to deliver high quality health
      service to a patient, they should be competent. Their proficiency should not only cover health
      policy but also leadership skills, social etiquette, system evaluation, teamwork among others. All
      nurses should take this initiative to improve their knowledge by achieving higher education
      programs to respond to the increasingly emerging patient demands. These would build them to
      be more qualified professionals in health sector hence effective delivery of services.<p>

      <p>Nurses should be complete partners with medical specialist and other Medicare
      professionals in re-strengthening and improving health care in the nations. Teamwork is a good
      aspect of quality work delivery since you gather knowledgeable information from different
      people and put them together to yield a comprehensive output which is quality work. Nurses are
      therefore encouraged to be full partners with other medical professionals to put efforts together
      to improve health care system and patient care. For one to be a full time partner includes
      participating together in leadership roles and taking responsibility in identifying plights at hand
      and solving them together. It’s a duty for all nurses to develop leadership proficiency and
      implement them as their responsibility for their own personal and professional growth.</p>

      <h2>Conclution</h2>
      <p>Patients have expectations from the health care services which are met either on low
      standards of services delivery or on high standard it depends with the performance of the health
      professionals. Therefore easy accessibility of standards for patient safety should be reinforced for
      higher performance in the medical centers to meet the patient expectation.</p>
